Automatically tracks Pokemon encounters, catches, faints, and soul links across multiple players in real-time using DeSmuME Lua scripts and a centralized web dashboard.

## 🎮 What is SoulLink?

**SoulLink** is a challenging Pokemon variant where 2-3 players play linked games:
- 🔗 Pokemon caught on the same route become "soul linked"
- 💀 If one linked Pokemon faints, **all linked Pokemon must be released**
- 🚫 **Dupes Clause**: Only first encounter of each species family counts
- 👥 **Species Clause**: Each player can only have one of each species family

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Automatic Detection**: DeSmuME Lua scripts detect encounters, catches, faints in real-time
- ⚡ **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live dashboard for all players
- 🔗 **SoulLink Rules**: Automatically enforces dupes clause, species clause, soul link creation
- 🎣 **Full Encounter Support**: Grass, water, fishing, headbutt, rock smash encounters
- 🌟 **Shiny Detection**: Automatically flags shiny Pokemon
- 📊 **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful real-time monitoring interface
- 🔒 **Secure**: JWT authentication per player
- 🏠 **Easy Setup**: Automated setup scripts for quick start

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Admins (Setting up the server)

**👑 If you're hosting the SoulLink run:**

1. **Download and run automated setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SoulLink_Tracker.git
   cd SoulLink_Tracker
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python scripts/start_playtest.py
   ```

2. **Follow the comprehensive guide**: [**ADMIN_SETUP.md**](ADMIN_SETUP.md)

### For Players (Joining a run)

**🎮 If you're a player joining someone else's SoulLink:**

1. **Get your player info** from the admin (name, token, server address)
2. **Follow the player guide**: [**PLAYER_SETUP.md**](PLAYER_SETUP.md)

## 📋 What You Need

### System Requirements

- 🐍 **Python 3.9+** 
- 🎮 **DeSmuME** (0.9.11+ with Lua support)
- 📀 **Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver ROM** (preferably randomized)
- 🌐 **Internet connection** (for multi-player setups)

### For Players

- **Just your computer** with DeSmuME and Python
- **Configuration files** from your admin
- **5 minutes** to set up

### For Admins  

- **One computer** to run the central server
- **Network setup** (port forwarding or tunneling for remote players)
- **10 minutes** to set up everything

## 🎯 How It Works

    D --> E[FastAPI Server]
    E --> F[WebSocket]
    F --> G[Web Dashboard]
    E --> H[Database]
```

1. **🎮 Play Pokemon** normally in DeSmuME
2. **📝 Lua script** automatically detects encounters, catches, faints
3. **🔄 Python watcher** sends events to central server
4. **⚡ Web dashboard** updates in real-time for all players
5. **🔗 Soul links** form automatically when players catch on same route
